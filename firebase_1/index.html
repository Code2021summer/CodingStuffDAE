                <h2>What is Mildly Fascinating?</h2>
                <p>It's a little place for me to share anything random that people might find fascinating. I'll post in-depth descriptions and explanations of pretty much anything that I think is worth learning a little about, whether it's the many worlds interpretaton of quantum mechanics or why oranges are called oranges. I really hope there's something here that you find mildly fascinating.</p>

                <p>Hey, so the world's amazing and possible infinite, and there's no way for me to find every mildly fascinating thing about it. If you have any ideas for a topic I should write about, I'd love to hear them.</p>
                <p>Tell me your great mildly fascinating idea here: <input type="text" id="idea" name="user_idea"></p>
