        <p>Plankton are extremely small living things that reside in the sea. A single planton is called a plankter. While most plankton are generally quite small, there are quite a few can be much bigger. However, the characteristic that keeps them all together is the fact that all plankton float around in the sea, and most can barely swim. Because of this, they just go with the flow of water currents. 
        </p>
        <p>There are two main types of plankton: Zooplankton and Phytoplankton. To simplify, zooplankton are more like animals while phytoplankton are more like plants. To complicate, see the chart below. &#40;There are also mycoplankton which are a plankton that resemble fungi, and I'll add a little thing about them at the bottom of the page.&#41;</p>

                    <td>They make their own food through photosynthesis &#40;Hence the <em>phyto</em> in phytoplankton&#41;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="row">Mobility</th>
                    <td>They can't move much since they're plankton &#40;and go with the currents&#41;, but some can swim a tiny bit.</td>
                    <td>They drift with the currents &#40;so they can't move akin to how plants can't move&#41;</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p>
            While zooplankton and phytoplankton are like animals and plants, they aren't technically animals and plants &#40;except when they are...&#41; Some examples of phytoplankton are actually bacteria or protists like algae. A lot of zooplankton are actually animals like jellyfish and fish. You might be thinking, "Wait, fish can swim. They don't drift like plankton!" You would be right. Most adult fish are not plankton. But a lot of baby fish &#40;called larvae&#41; are technically plankton.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just because an organism is a plankton now, doesn't mean it will be a plankton forever. Some animals are plankton when they're young because they haven't yet grown enough to swin against the current. Because of this, they float. These are called meroplankton &#40;part-time plankton&#41;. Plankton that are plankton for all their lives are called holoplankton.

            Mycoplankton are plankton that obtian food in a similar way to fungi &#40;fungi includes orgnaisms like mushrooms and yeast&#41;. They can either break down organic material &#40;like dead plankton&#41; into food for them, or they can act like parasites and steal nutrients from other organisms. They're pretty fascinating!
