        <p>Plankton are extremely small living things that reside in the sea. While most plankton are generally quite small, there are quite a few can be much bigger. However, the characteristic that keeps them all together is the fact that all plankton float around in the sea, and most can barely swim. Because of this, they just go with the flow of water currents. 
        </p>
        <p>There are two main types of plankton: Zooplankton and Phytoplankton. To simplify, zooplankton are more like animals while phytoplankton are more like plants. To complicate, see the chart below. &#40;There are also mycoplankton which are a plankton that resemble fungi, and I'll add a little thing about them at the bottom of the page.&#41;</p>

            While zooplankton and phytoplankton are like animals and plants, they aren't technically animals and plants &#40;except when they are...&#41;
