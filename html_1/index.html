                <h2>What is Mildly Fascinating?</h2>
                <p>It's a little place for me to share anything random that people might find fascinating. I'll post in-depth descriptions and explanations of pretty much anything that I think is worth learning a little about, whether it's the many worlds interpretaton of quantum mechanics or why oranges are called oranges. I really hope there's something here that you find mildly fascinating.</p>
